# School Code

this will be updated as time passes, but here are some of the code folders I have worked on in school :-) folders will generally correspond with the lists here. 


I will also provide textbooks if necessary!


# The Odin Project and Free Code Camp

Both great resources, I utilized:

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

and [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) resources.

I continue to use FreeCodeCamp videos today for several purposes.
